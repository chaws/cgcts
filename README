This folder contains all scripts used to import the Darpa Cyber Grand Challenge
(https://github.com/cybergrandchallenge) into SARD.

My strategy will be sharing half of my day trying to automate bug triggering in order
to extract all useful line numbers. Since that might not work, I will spend the 
other half of my day going at it, test by test, manually yanking flawed lines on my own.

Also, there will be always two versions of a test case
1. one where it's Patched and
2. one where with the else of the Patched ifdef

Libraries will be STATICALLY compiled before test cases.
The static library `libcgc.a` will contain compiled files of
1. libcgc.c
2. ansi_x931_aes128.c  
3. maths.S  
4. tiny-AES128-C/aes.c

The `libpov.a` file will contain all files within `libpov` directory.

Apparently, all projects that need a malloc function will have them implemented within itself
